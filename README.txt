My three peers and I have created a book search engine called www.justcompare.in. This website compares the prices of the book available in different websites and shows the result with lowest price option. We have used Python as the scripting langauge and PostgreSQL for the database. We have considered six websites for the comparision and out of them I have written code for three of the crawlers naming crossword,homeshop18 and indiaplaza.
